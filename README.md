Applying different CNN Models By adding Deep layers to models to Predict or Classify the Target of each different dataset of images or Videos ,or Using Transfer Learning idea by using pre-trained Models like VGG16 ,VGG19 ,INCEPTIONV3 ,and RESNET with their weights and modify them to be appropriate model for the dataset
